## Notes
### Training resources from the University of Cambridge
If you are a current student or staff at the University, consider browsing the University's training booking [system](https://www.training.cam.ac.uk). It is a central point to search for and book onto a variety of training courses. These courses are run by University training providers, are generally very high quality, and are (mostly) free for University members.

You could make the search work better for you, by limiting the search to a specific training provider or department. At time of writing, the option to do so is at the top of the page.

Please be aware that the popular courses tend to fill out extremely quickly. We have seen courses fill up few months in advance. This is often true for data analysis, statistics and programming oriented courses.

Our advice is to **book early**. If possible, ask to be signed up for one of the mailing lists (i.e. via your department, or email the training system). There are also options to go onto *waiting lists* or *register your interest* if all the places are filled.

### Coursera
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) is an online learning platform. Many universities and organisations offer courses, specialisations and even online degrees in a variety of subjects. We recommend browsing the platform yourself to see if there is something that you'd enjoy, not mentioned on this website.

While one would most likely get the fullest out of Coursera with a paid subscription, there are a substantial number of free components which might be helpful for some.

On a course's landing page (example [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)), you will see an option to "Enroll". Many courses have an **audit** option, which allows you to see most course materials for free.

However, the drawback is not being to submit certain assignments or get grades/feedback for your work. Our experience is that you are still able to participate ask Q&As on the forums, but this might vary from course to course. Also, you will not be able to receive a Course Certificate, which is an official credential from Coursera confirming that you have finished the course. Read more about this and the other paid enrollment [ options](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818613-Enrollment-options).

This website will include only courses which are free, or at least offer an audit option.
