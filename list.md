## Coding
Learning to code or program is easier by doing (for most people). The following links teach you to code in a specific language, whilst achieving a particular purpose.

### R
R is mostly utilised for data analysis and statistics.

{% include r-found.md %}

{% include r-r4ds.md %}

### Python
Python is an extremely flexible and easy-to-learn programming language suited for various tasks. Learning Python is significantly easier, if you are using it for a particular problem, rather than just applying it vaguely without a proper context. We learning recommend learning Python 3, instead of the legacy Python 2. 

[Python for Data Science and AI](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-applied-data-science-ai?specialization=ibm-data-science) is a course offered by IBM on Coursera, which covers the basics of Python in a data science context.

*Think Python 2nd Edition*, by Allen Downey. The author has generously made the  book available [online](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/). Very general, concise and covers the basics needed for software building.

*Python Programming for Biology: Bioinformatics and Beyond*, by Tim J. Stevens & Wayne Boucher. It is a good Python guide in the context of bioinformatics. Cambridge University provides [online access](https://www-cambridge-org.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/core/books/python-programming-for-biology/61762A9F672FDD8B2DD3FFF8773027B2) (note: you need your Raven login).


## Data Science
{% include r-r4ds.md %}

{% include data-ml.md %}

Coursera features a Data Science [specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science), offered by IBM. Individual courses:

* [What is Data Science?](https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-datascience?specialization=ibm-data-science#syllabus): a basic introduction to data science concepts.
* [Tools for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/open-source-tools-for-data-science?specialization=ibm-data-science): learn about the tools people use in data science.
* [Data Science Methodology](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-methodology?specialization=ibm-data-science#syllabus): the steps involved in data science.
* [Python for Data Science and AI](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-applied-data-science-ai?specialization=ibm-data-science): the basics of Python in a data science context.


## Static page web design
*Recommended for relatively advanced users with knowledge of command-line and some basic programming.*

If you're interested in a free and easy way to build your own personal home page, **Jekyll** is a static site generator which is integrated into GitHub Pages. In fact, this is the very framework used to generate this website.

There's not a comprehensible course or book about Jekyll, but it's worth checking these to get you started:

* Documentation on [Jekyll homepage](https://jekyllrb.com)
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) website

You may also benefit from studying some HTML + CSS. I recommend Shay Howe's [*Learn to Code HTML & CSS*](https://learn.shayhowe.com).
